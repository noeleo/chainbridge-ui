  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

  <p>
    The operators of the Bridge will be referred to as the “Operators”. Anyone
    who uses the Bridge will be referred to as “User”. The UI hosted at
    <a href="https://www.shyftbridge.com">shyftbridge.com</a>, any other
    affiliated UI sites, and their associated Shyft ERC-20 wrapping
    functionality will be referred to as “Bridge.”
  </p>

  <p>
    By using the Bridge, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The Operators have no responsibility for explaining how to use the Bridge
      in any capacity. Any explainer videos or documentation are a courtesy and
      not subject to accuracy. It is solely the responsibility of the User to
      learn how to use the Bridge correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Operators assume no liability for lost funds through use of the Bridge
      or any associated documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transactions made on the Bridge are not reversible and the User must be
      sure of any actions taken, as mistakes may cause catastrophic loss of
      funds.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Bridge may be offline and unavailable for use from time to time
      without warning. The Bridge may be updated from time to time, which may
      make certain aspects of the Bridge less functional.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Bridge fees may change dramatically at any time with no warning. The
      Bridge fees are non-refundable, even if a transaction does not complete
      and fees are paid. The Bridge fees are set by, and at the sole discretion
      of, the Operators.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Operators are not responsible for any questions or answers, and have
      no help desk to respond to queries. If one of the Operators responds to an
      inquiry, it is at their own discretion. Any response is not to be
      construed as financial, legal or technical advice.
    </li>
    <li>
      The implementation of the Bridge is the creation of
      <a href="https://chainsafe.io">ChainSafe Systems</a> and any technical
      questions must be referred to them. Any desired changes to the Bridge may
      be addressed to the
      <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge">ChainBridge</a> GitHub.
    </li>
    <li>
      The implementation of the Bridge UI is also the creation of
      <a href="https://chainsafe.io">ChainSafe Systems</a>. Any desired changes
      to the Bridge UI may be addressed to the
      <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-ui">ChainBridge-UI</a>
      GitHub.
    </li>
    <li>
      The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Operators from any
      claims, financial loss, or cost associated in conjunction with use of the
      Bridge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Bridge is an open-source UI that is being run by the Operators. Any
      other party who is unsatisfied with the functionality or pricing of the
      Bridge can, at any time, run their own. There is no limit to the amount of
      bridges that can be available for the Shyft Network. Please refer to
      <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge"
